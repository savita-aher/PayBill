Implemented basic form validation using any combination of built-in HTML validation attributes and DOM-event-driven JavaScript validation.
(ADDED login page which uses required,built in HTML validation attributes like required,type,checkbox )

use this credintial to Login to Dashboard:
  const validUsername = 'admin'
  const validPassword = '123456'

Dashboard shows current date and time which uses the BOM’s Date() object and updates the DOM.
